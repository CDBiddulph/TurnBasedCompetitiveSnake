# Turn Based Competitive Snake
This React game is based on the classic arcade game Snake, but with a strategic twist. Two players take turns moving their own snake one unit, while picking up fruit to grow their snake longer. The object of the game is to force the other player to trap themselves so that they cannot make any more moves, while avoiding the same fate yourself.
In the future, I'd like to add an AI that competes against a human player using reinforcement learning. I'm currently taking a reinforcement learning class, so I hope I'll be able to apply the skills I learn there.
